I'm not writing this to be a long post, and I'm hoping to start having more technical posts come out soon. 

Today is the 3rd anniversary of my father's passing. I enrolled in the Learn.co program mainly as a way to improve my life so I could provide for my family in his absence. It turns out that my family figured out how to take care of themselves on their own. I guess it was to be expected. After all, they're all really hard working people. Since they've all found their way, I have to find mine too. They've been taking leaps and bounds, and I've mainly just been watching them while holding down a job to keep things stable. 

I know that my father wouldn't be happy with where my life is now. I've played it safe and boring for a good long while, and I don't think I'll ever stop wanting to make relatviely safe moves. On the other hand, being safe doesn't mean being stagnant. I've always been intrigued by programming's power to create and by all the doors it could open in someone's life. I don't know if it will take 2 whole years or not, but by the time September 12, 2020 comes around I want to be a full-time developer so that I can honor my father's memory and live my life to the fullest.
